    As I think about my career, what stands out most is how unique my experience has
been. I’ve studied multiple subjects in depth and gained a wide range of work experience for
someone my age. At just twenty-three years old, I often find myself sitting at the table with
people much older than me. The areas I’ve thought about most are my college experience, my
role as a field engineer, and my leadership development. My unique career path has given me
insight into a variety of complex topics. Finding my voice and purpose at a young age allowed
me to express myself and pursue my passions. </p>

<p>

    My time in college was both rewarding and extremely challenging. I originally planned to
study business, but after taking an introductory coding course, I changed my path. That class
introduced me to the foundations of critical thinking and using software to solve complex
problems. I remember being overwhelmed by different parts of the program. However, the time
management skills I developed helped me push through. I loved the freedom I had in college.
Every day felt like a new adventure, and I often wish I could return to that level of freedom. I
wasn’t the best student at first. I stayed late in the lab countless times to grasp tricky concepts.
While other students were out having fun, I was struggling—but that struggle taught me how to
pace myself and focus on what really mattered in life.
</p>

<p>

    As a field engineer, I face countless tasks and challenges on a daily basis. The first time
I went to a job site, I was terrified. I remember feeling overwhelmed by all the moving parts. I
had to remind myself that I belonged there. On-site, the engineer is in charge, overseeing a
union crew as they perform their duties. As a young professional, I initially struggled to find my
voice and speak up to those with more experience. What makes me unique is that I didn’t back
down. I always pushed my team to do what was right. The knowledge and discipline I developed
in school prepared me for those moments. I often had to enforce safety rules, like reminding
crew members to wear their protective equipment. While I occasionally received negative
comments, my focus remained on safety. That experience has made me take safety more
seriously in my personal life as well. It made me reflect on everyday choices—how I drive, what
I eat—and how I can protect myself for the sake of those who care about me.</p>

<p>
    One of the most defining aspects of who I am is my leadership experience. Whether in
my personal life or at work, I’m someone people naturally turn to. Sometimes that means
offering support; other times, it means taking on tough assignments. It's humbling to realize that
others now look up to me. I used to be the one looking up, wondering how older professionals
got where they are. I still feel like I’m learning every day, but as a leader, I always put others
first. The best leaders advocate for their team and push everyone to do the right thing. When I
was a baseball umpire, I would always tell new umpires that the most important thing is effort.
Trying your best is all anyone can ask of you. I struggled with that idea for a long time, but by
teaching it to others, I came to believe it myself. Through reflection, I’ve realized how important
it is to take up space, prioritize safety, and always give your best.</p>
<p>

    My ultimate career goal is to become a project manager. In that role, I would oversee the
engineering and construction of new projects. It’s a position that combines everything I’ve talked
about—leadership, communication, technical skill, and responsibility. A project manager must
be a natural leader who puts people first, understands the technical side of engineering, and
can coordinate effectively with both internal teams and construction crews. They must also be
confident when speaking with clients and stakeholders because they are the face of the project.
Every day presents a new challenge, requiring balance and adaptability. To reach that goal, I am
currently working toward an MBA and preparing to earn my Professional Engineering license.
With both technical expertise and business acumen, I’ll be ready to manage successful projects
from start to finish.
