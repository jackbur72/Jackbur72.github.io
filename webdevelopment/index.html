    <h2>
        Welcome Statement 
    </h2>

    <p>
Welcome to the Jack Burgess Professional Website. I’m excited to showcase who I am and
what I can do.
    </p>

     <h3>
        Objectives and Goals
    </h3>

    <p>
The goal of this website is to bring all my work into one place, where I’ll be sharing and
discussing the projects I’ve worked on over the years. It’s also a space where you can learn
more about me. You’ll find details about my background, education, certifications, and work
experience, so you can get a better idea of who I am and what I do. The site includes an About
page with all that information. There’s also a Projects page featuring work from different areas,
including my professional projects. Here I will be explaining my current and previous jobs.
These examples demonstrate how I approach problems and find creative solutions. Finally,
there’s a Reflection page where I share some of the key lessons I’ve learned throughout my
career. I also explain how those experiences have impacted my personal life. I hope this
website gives you a closer look into the person I’ve become.
