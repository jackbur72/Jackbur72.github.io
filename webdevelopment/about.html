    About Jack Burgess
</h2>

<p>
Hello, my name is Jack Burgess. This is a short bit about some of my personal goals and hobbies.
I am an avid outdoorsman, and I enjoy nothing more than fishing with my friends.
Spending time in reflection is another hobby of mine—I enjoy the quietness of it all.
I live my life one day at a time, with both long- and short-term goals to keep me moving forward.
One of my short-term goals is to become a better programmer. To achieve this, I am creating some websites using HTML and CSS.
I was born and raised in Bentonville, Arkansas. My youth was filled with bike rides and time spent with my dogs.
During that time, I also found myself by surrounding myself with others and staying busy.
I am always busy, as I am a full-time employee and a graduate student.
To learn more about my resume, please scroll down. I’ve also included a quote I really enjoy.
