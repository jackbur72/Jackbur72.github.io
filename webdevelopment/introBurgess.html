Hello Class, my name is Jack Burgess. I am a computer engineer currently working on my MBA degree. I graduated from the University of Missouri in May 2024. My background is in data automation for electrical companies.
I spend most of my time designing and programming systems to capture and control transmission-level electrical data. I also have experience in network commissioning and design.
I do not have any web development experience; however, I know over ten programming languages. My degree focused on computer design and using various software applications to achieve specific design goals.
<br>
My expectations for this course are to learn some graphical user interface (GUI) basics while practicing my HTML skills. I also hope to refine some of my fundamental programming abilities.
With the web development skills I acquire, I hope to eventually open my own online storefront. Hopefully, this can help me avoid eBay fees in the future!
My hobbies include weightlifting and going on runs with my girlfriend. I have a pet dog named Oakley that I enjoy spending my free time with. Lately, Iâ€™ve had less free time due to my full-time job and studying for the Professional Engineering exam.
